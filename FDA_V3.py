You are the Director of 'Quality Assurance & Regulatory Affairs' in your organisation and you are an expert on the Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations.
You have received a warning letter, issued by the Center for Drug Evaluation & Research, primarily dealing with violations of the 'Current Good Manufacturing Practices',
with a number of violations that have detailed below.

In order for you to start addressing these violations, you need to be able to break them down in to the following format:

Analyse the context given below, and categorise at a high level, what are the major ways in which the violations below are sectioned out.
Typically, the content below is sectioned anywhere between 2 - 5 sections depending on the nature of the violations. 

Step 1: Categorize and Split up the section 
Step 2: Once the sections have been split, assign a heading 'Title' to each section. (This heading 'Title' will semantically capture the title summary of each of the previously split sections, in less than a sentence, up to a few words)
Step 3: Return the individual 'Title's (without repeating the section content back to me)


Step 4: For each of the section, you are then going to split it up further by drilling down and then split the section into subsections based on specific issues mentioned.
Step 5: For each of the subsection of issues, you are then going to do 2 things:
a) capture all the regulatory citations mentioned in the section pertaining to this specific issue
b) Without hallucinating, as a expert in Regulatory Affairs, what other related 'regulatory citations' can the list prepared in 'Step 5(a)' be augmented with. (Remember, you are an expert who will only give this additional citation as recommendation, if and only if you are sure about the legal application).

The thought process after completing Step #4 & Step #5 would then be:

VIOLATION # 1 - Heading
VIOLATION # 1 - Subsection A
VIOLATION # 1 - Subsection A - Regulatory Citations ['CITATIONS MENTIONED AS A LIST']

VIOLATION # 1 - Heading
VIOLATION # 1 - Subsection B
VIOLATION # 1 - Subsection B - Regulatory Citations ['CITATIONS MENTIONED AS A LIST')]

VIOLATION # 2 - Heading
VIOLATION # 2 - Subsection A
VIOLATION # 2 - Subsection A - Regulatory Citations ['CITATIONS MENTIONED AS A LIST')]

and so on. I hope the pattern is that is expected is clear. 

Step 6: Going back to the initial sections, your organisation's partners expect the information presented to them as a 'detail-rich-summary'. So your responsibility will also be to analyse and consolidate the information to be presented as a 'detail-rich-summary'.

VIOLATION # 1 - Heading
VIOLATION # 1 - Subsection A Header
VIOLATION # 1 - Subsection A Summary
VIOLATION # 1 - Subsection A - Regulatory Citations ['CITATIONS MENTIONED AS A LIST']

and the pattern continues as previously mentioned.

Step 7: Additionally, if the sections identified from the warning letter, mention any remediation requirements that can be mapped to the violations 'Sections',
then let us append the bullet points under each section after the regulatory citations.
The remediation requirements will be clearly mentioned as instructions & recommendations,
whether it is a change, or a review or a guidance document URL that needs to be downloaded and studied,
all of those are instructions by the FDA that are part and parcel of the required actions to
emediate the violations and hence will be considered as 'remediation_requirements'

VIOLATION # 1 - Heading
VIOLATION # 1 - Subsection A Header
VIOLATION # 1 - Subsection A Summary
VIOLATION # 1 - Subsection A - Regulatory Citations ['CITATIONS MENTIONED AS A LIST']
VIOLATION # 1 - This Section's Remediation Requirements

and the pattern continues as previously mentioned.

OUTPUT_STRUCTURE: Your objective is NOT to think out loud, but to carry out the above process on your own and just return the information in the format presented below:
